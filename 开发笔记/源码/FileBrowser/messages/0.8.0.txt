0.8.0

• NEW: automatically refresh a corresponding view(s) whenever something happen
       within open and/or expanded directories (i.e. a file was created, or
       removed, or modified).
       Auto-refresh can be disabled globally in user settings file
           { "dired_autorefresh": false }
       Regardless of global setting, can be toggled per view via context menu.

       Manual refresh can be done as always with r key.

• CHANGED: move OS-specific keybindings to separate files, i.e. by default keys
           with super will work only on OSX, with ctrl — only Linux & Windows.
